- üëã Hi,  I'm Angel, a dedicated Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst honing my skills at the TripleTen bootcamp, with my journey spaning a swift 4 months. My passion lies in unraveling insights from data and crafting and learning from it. I love to provide compelling narratives to drive strategic decision-making that ACTUALLY leaves an impact.

With a keen eye for detail and a knack for translating data into actionable insights, I specialize in harnessing the power of analytics tools like Tableau, SQL, Power BI, and data visualization techniques. I'm eager to dive into the realm of media & communications, armed with a thirst for growth and innovation.

Currently, I'm immersed in the world of customer data, exploring avenues to expand reach and enhance business metrics. Drawing from my experiences in BI and collaboration with stakeholders, I've sharpened my communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills, ready to tackle any challenge head-on. Additionally I have years of hands-on experience dealing with customers and driving performance in a 1-on-1 environment. I have a keen understanding of consumer patterns and trends at intimate level that translates into my insights and analysis'.

My journey at TripleTen has been exhilarating, delving into a curriculum that encompasses the essentials of BI analysis. From mastering data manipulation with SQL to crafting visually stunning dashboards with tools like Tableau, I've embraced each learning opportunity with enthusiasm.

During my tenure, I also had the privilege of participating in a catalouge of different projects , where I tackled a real-world business challenge alongside professionals from Norbu, a wellness app company. It was a rewarding experience that further solidified my passion for leveraging data to drive positive change. On another notable occassion I worked with real-world data on AirBnb to segment it and organize it into a dataset that provided handfuls of valuable insights.

A few fun facts about me:

‚úùÔ∏è I am Christian, what I believe that brings to the workplace is an attitude to work hard! I will go far and beyond to make sure I am doing my best even as long as I am not spread out too thin. I love pushing my collegues/ co-workers to encourage great work in way that seems fit. I thrive in professional settings that work in a tightly-knit and orderly fashion. I bring an encouraging attitude that focuses on collaboration where needed and where everyone can aim to make an impact. I relish participating in a co-leadership role, particularly those where collaboration, good teamwork and continous learning are practiced. I believe this helps facilitate an approach to data analysis that allows all cogs on the machine to move smoothly.

üèãüèª Fitness is my other passion, and you might catch me pounding the weights as I train to get myself into good shape. Powerlifting is my ultimate goal once I bodybuild (not professionally) long enough.
When it comes to food, I'm all about convenience, and simplicity. I don't mind a plain burger with no buns or anything else, just salt and pepper! Once and a while on a day off I'll cook for myself or dine somewhere nice. 


üìä As for my aspirations, I'm focused on landing a position in the realm of data analytics, and as for outside of work, I would like a farm in a deserty area like Nevada or Arizona.
